        <p> Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (Octoberâ€“November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[57] The innings was described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[58] The innings set various records including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[59] a record only broken after seven years by Shane Watson.[60] Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346)[61] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI.[62]</p>
